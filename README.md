Code for assignment 2 for Digital Image Processing at Mizzou. 

# Requirements: 

- Part 1: Write a program that conduct image smoothing on a given image with the following methods. a) Mean Filtering (Averaging); b) Gaussian smoothing; c) Median Filtering. Run your algorithm on the book example images of chapter 3 (Figure 0312, 0333, 0334, and 0335). Try different kernel size. You can test on any additional images as well.

- Part 2: Write a program that conduct image sharpening on a given image. Run your algorithm on the book example images of chapter 3 (Figure 0338, and 0340). You can test on any additional images as well.

- Part 3:Write a program that build a Gaussian Pyramid on a given image. You should display the Gaussian Pyramid in the same fashion as slide 57 (second to the last page) in the lecture ppt. Run your algorithm on the lena image (you need to convert the color image into grayscale image first). You can test on any additional images as well.
